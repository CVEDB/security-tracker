Subject: About the security issues affecting {{ package }} in Buster

Dear maintainer(s),

The Debian LTS team recently reviewed the security issue(s) affecting your
package in Buster:
{%- if cve -%}
{% for entry in cve %}
https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/{{ entry }}
{%- endfor -%}
{%- else %}
https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/{{ package }}
{%- endif %}

We decided that we would not prepare a buster security update (usually
because the security impact is low and that we concentrate our limited
resources on higher severity issues and on the most widely used packages).
That said the buster users would most certainly benefit from a fixed
package.

If you want to work on such an update, you're welcome to do so. Please
try to follow the workflow we have defined here:
https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Development

If that workflow is a burden to you, feel free to just prepare an
updated source package and send it to debian-lts@lists.debian.org (via a
debdiff, or with an URL pointing to the source package, or even with a
pointer to your packaging repository), and the members of the LTS team
will take care of the rest. However please make sure to submit a tested
package.

Thank you very much.

  on behalf of the Debian LTS team.
