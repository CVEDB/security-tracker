Subject: Buster update of {{ package }} (minor security issues)?

The Debian LTS team recently reviewed the security issue(s) affecting your
package in Buster:
{%- if cve -%}
{% for entry in cve %}
https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/{{ entry }}
{%- endfor -%}
{%- else %}
https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/{{ package }}
{%- endif %}

We decided that a member of the LTS team should take a look at this
package, although the security impact of still open issues is low. When
resources are available on our side, one of the LTS team members will
start working on fixes for those minor security issues, as we think that
the buster users would most certainly benefit from a fixed package.

If you'd rather want to work on such an update yourself, you're welcome
to do so. Please send us a short notification to the debian-lts mailing
list (debian-lts@lists.debian.org), expressing your intention to work on
issues yourself. Otherwise, no action is required from your side.

When working on issues, please try to follow the workflow we have defined
here: https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Development

If that workflow is a burden to you, feel free to just prepare an
updated source package and send it to debian-lts@lists.debian.org (via a
debdiff, or with an URL pointing to the source package, or even with a
pointer to your packaging repository), and the members of the LTS team
will take care of the rest. However please make sure to submit a tested
package.

Thank you very much.
