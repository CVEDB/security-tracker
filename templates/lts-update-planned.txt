Subject: Buster update of {{ package }}?

Dear maintainer(s),

The Debian LTS team would like to fix the security issues which are
currently open in the Buster version of {{ package }}:
{%- if cve -%}
{% for entry in cve %}
https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/{{ entry }}
{%- endfor -%}
{%- else %}
https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/{{ package }}
{%- endif %}

Would you like to take care of this yourself?

If yes, please follow the workflow we have defined here:
https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Development

If that workflow is a burden to you, feel free to just prepare an
updated source package and send it to debian-lts@lists.debian.org
(via a debdiff, or with an URL pointing to the source package,
or even with a pointer to your packaging repository), and the members
of the LTS team will take care of the rest. Indicate clearly whether you
have tested the updated package or not.

If you don't want to take care of this update, it's not a problem, we
will do our best with your package. Just let us know whether you would
like to review and/or test the updated package before it gets released.

You can also opt-out from receiving future similar emails in your
answer and then the LTS Team will take care of {{ package }} updates
for the LTS releases.

Thank you very much.
