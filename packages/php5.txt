LTS-specific instructions
-------------------------

php5 tends to have a regular flow of security updates, so when you add
it to dla-needed.txt, you should define a target release date and
fixes for the various CVE published should be added progressively
to the git repository in collab-maint (branch debian/wheezy):
https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/collab-maint/debian-lts/php5.git
git clone git.debian.org:/git/collab-maint/debian-lts/php5.git

Please leave a comment in dla-needed.txt which explains the above
instructions.

Obviously a severe vulnerability can lead to an early publication
of the update (i.e. before the planned release date).
