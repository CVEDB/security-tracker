Build
-----

We follow the upstream releases in oldstable and stable, i.e. the version in sid
is recompiled. The package scripts automatically create the control and rules
with the appropriate dependencies. 

- You need to download the fixed package from unstable
- Modify the version number to something like 6b31-1.13.3-1~deb7u1
- Regenerate the control/rules file: (squeeze is also supported)
  touch debian/control.in; debian/rules debian/control distrel=wheezy
- Build with "-sa" (since each security update usually updates to a new release)

Testing
-------

OpenJDK has an extensive test suite, the result should be compared with previous
build logs.

Other than that some functionality tests of Java packages in the archive or with
openjdk-6-demos.
