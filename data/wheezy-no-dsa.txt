This file keeps track of things that we can mark savely no-dsa in Wheezy due to
the functionality not being available:

- qemu,kvm:
  - 9pfs backend handle: not supported since Wheezy's glibc lacks open_by_handle_at
  - 9pfs backend proxy: not supported since Wheezy doesn't ship virtfs-proxy-helper
