Agenda for Security Team Meeting
--------------------------------

Workflow
========

- Improvements needed for dsa-needed.txt, like more automatisation? The repo
  with embargoed issues isn't used much, what can we do to improve that?

- Is RT abandoned, do we still need to clean up old issues from the security
  queues?

- Draft new people, possible candidates

- Opening up the security process further to allow maintainers of packages with
  frequent issues to release updates themselves. Needs a more detailed workplan:
  - Updates need to be reviewed/acked by sec team members

  - Requires changes to dak to no longer require access to security-master,
    e.g.  by using a mechanism similar to allowing a DM to upload and sending
    error messages to the signer of the upload (already requested by Thijs)

  - Requires changes to debian-security-announce

- Fix up DSA candidates script to only present packages with open issues not in
  dsa-needed and not tagged no-dsa
  DONE -- raphael

Tools
=====

- Compile a list of issues we want to see fixed

- Make it simple to release packages for others to test, e.g. an aptable
  security queue, what is needed to implement that?

- How can we leverage autopkgtest for testing security updates in jessie?

- Migrate to git during the weekend? Since most people are around and we'll be
  actively using all tools anyway, we can fix all fallout right-away.

- Move remaining cronjobs (daily DSA mail, external check) to the role account
  - check-external: done
  - dsa candidates: wip
  - daily dsa: ?
  - unknown packages: ?

Tracker
=======

- Add a new status to differentiate between "no-dsa, if the maintainer wants
  to fix in a point update go ahead" and "no-dsa, was ignored because it's
  possible to backport" (this is e.g. needed to cover non-backportable issues
  like CVE-2013-4148 et al. for KVM).

- Check open bugs in the BTS, check bugs against security-tracker pseudo package

- Support for consistency checks on source package names, e.g linux-2.6/linux
  or all of the ruby packages, track package renames

- Automatically add <end-of-life> tags for unsupported packages

- Add a view "all unfixed bugs without a recorded bug" to simplify filing bugs

- More systematic tracking of CVE requests?

- Automating more tasks:
  + dropping "NOTE: to be rejected" when an issue is marked as REJECTED
  + script to automatically merge data/next-{oldstable-,}point-update.txt
  + get an overview of newly reported bugs in the Debian BTS which have
    tag security (if one submits a bug not over reportbug we do not get
    a copy)?
  + Automatically group/reorder unassigned CVE-$year-XXXX item to have
    them in one place and get a better overview?


Documentation
=============

- Work on proper documentation how people can contribute

- Remove mentions of the "testing security team" since that doesn't
  seem to exist anymore

- Fix and upload harden-doc (securing debian manual)

Distribution hardening
======================

- What new hardening features should we tackle for stretch?
  + PIE on at least amd64 (i386)

- systemd hardening features; identify a set of important packages

- improve detection of hardened build flags, maybe write the flags used into an
  ELF section? This way it could be more reliably checked whether correct flags
  were used (e.g. for binaries using fortified source, but not using any of the
  functions covered by it)

- hidepid by default

- Root-less Xorg

jessie
======

- Discuss list of open problematic packages (if not resolved by then)
  * Docker

- Start getting required in place for jessie-security:
  - buildds
  - security-master
  - etc.

- Get more prominence/exposure for 'needrestart'?

LTS
===

- Review; what is working well, how is it keeping up, we can we do to help?

- What tool changes need to be made?

  - Auto-adding <end-of-life> markers for new commits

Others
======

- Distribute the new security team key on 

- Add debian-security-support to wheezy

- Check status of spu notifications and restore this if possible

- Finetune DSA mails/template, e.g. add team@security.debian.org
  as contact address (note contact address is in DSA template already)
