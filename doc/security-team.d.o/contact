This is more a TODO list/work in progress to improve documentation

Mail
----

- Specify public/private

What each list is for:
----------------------

- team@security.debian.org / security@debian.org (security team contact)
- debian-security@lists.debian.org (public discussion list)
- debian-security@debian.org seems to be redirected to debian-private@lists.debian.org
- debian-security-tracker@lists.debian.org (security tracker discussion list)
- (and more)
- consolidate lists? (which are needed? explicit names, e.g., -public/-private)
- RT? (incoming queue for non encrypted mails)

IRC Channel
-----------

We hang-out in the #debian-security channel on OFTC
(https://www.oftc.net/), stop by if you'd like. We can also add you to
the Alioth project so you have SVN write permission, and you can test
drive it on the testing issues for however long you like to get an idea
or feel comfortable (and hey, it really helps!).
