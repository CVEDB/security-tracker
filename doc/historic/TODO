* Set up for DTSAs

  - Auto moderation of developer signed mails to -announce.

  - sndadvisory should remove TODO lines from the list file since the
    advisory is complete

  - merge sndadvisory into dtsa script?

  - web DTSA pages should be built on the fly using the metadata in DTSA/
    so we don't have to update things in two places when making a change,
    and so releasing a DTSA does not involve copying html files around

  - The dtsa script should have support for updating the list file
    when running it on an advisory that it's already been run on before.
    This would facilitate issuing asvisories, which often takes a few runs
    before the final one is sent. Alternatively, get rid of the DTSA/list
    file (do we need it for anything really?)

* Merge stuff into security.debian.org. Long term, but we need to keep in
  mind that the current archive setup is just to get bootstrapped.

* Web overview
  - checklist setup for unstable needs to be fixed to ignore Hurd

* Florian's overview should be moved to secure-testing.debian.net, but
  Florian wants to resolve some issues before.

* Write the script that digs through the security bugs

* Write the script that handles the transfer between secure-testing and testing
  wrt incomplete archs (aba)

* Improve the developer's reference wrt security bugs (micah)

* Document that finalized syntax

* Review open security bugs and tag the wrt versioned bug tracking

* Create a repo of security patches

* Retroactive updating of the list for not-affected and others

* Document all our stuff and work

* Implement the HELP tag and add it to some outstanding issues

* Link source package specific overview into the PTS
