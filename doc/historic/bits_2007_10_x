Hi fellow developers,

We finally got around to sending this email to inform you about the
current state of the Testing Security team and its work.

If you at any stage have questions about the Testing Security team,
please feel free to come to #debian-security on OFTC or write an email to
secure-testing-team@lists.alioth.debian.org .



Security status of testing
--------------------------

Thanks to an increased size of our team, Debian Lenny is in good shape with
respect to security and has been so for some time. We expect to be able to
keep up this level of security support (at least) until the release of Lenny.

In the weeks immediately after the release of Etch there were some security
support problems for testing. We hope to improve our processes so that we won't
run into the same problems after the release of Lenny. There will be another
announcement about the state of these efforts well before Lenny's release.

Our web page[0] has been updated to reflect the current status.



New announcement mails
----------------------

Previously we were mimicing the announcement method that Stable security
uses by providing DTSAs (Debian Testing Security Advisories). However,
these were only prepared for issues that required us to manually prepare
package updates, thereby forcing a package into testing that would not
otherwise migrate automatically in a reasonable time-frame. This resulted
in very infrequent DTSAs because most of the security issues were dealt
with by fixed packages migrating from unstable to testing.

Therefore, we set up daily announcements (delivered to the
announcement mailinglist[1]), which include all new security fixes for
the testing distribution. Most commonly the email shows the migrated
packages. If there has been a DTSA issued for a package, this will
show up as well.

In some rare cases, the Testing Security team asks the release
managers to remove a package from testing, because a security fix in a
reasonable amount of time seems to be unlikely and the package should
not be part of testing in our opinion. In this case, the email will
additionally include information about the removal.



Efforts to fix security issues in unstable
------------------------------------------

The Testing Security team works mainly on assigned CVE numbers but
also follows security relevant bugs reported via the BTS. If you
encounter a security problem in one of your packages, which does not
have a CVE number yet, please contact the Testing Security team.  It
is important to have a CVE id allocated, because they allow us to
track the security problem in all Debian branches (including Debian
stable).  When you upload a security fix to unstable, please also
include the CVE id in your changelog and set the urgency to high. The
tracker used by both the Testing and Stable Security teams, can be
found on this webpage[2].

The main task of the Testing Security team is to review CVE id
relevance to Debian, informing Debian maintainers by filing bugs to
the BTS (if not already done) and chasing the security fix to move it
faster into testing.  Whenever possible, we try to provide patches and
sometimes also NMU the packages in unstable. Please do not regard an
NMU by the Testing Security team as a bad sign. We try to assist you
in the best way to keep Debian secure. Also keep in mind that not all
security related problems have a grave severity, so do not be
surprised if a normal bug in the Debian BTS results in assigning a CVE
id for it.  An up to date overview of unresolved issues in unstable
can be found on the tracker website[3].



Efforts to fix security issues in testing
-----------------------------------------

Our efforts to keep testing secure are primarily focused around
letting fixed packages migrate from unstable. In order to
ensure this migration process, we are in close contact with the
release team and request priority bumps to speed up the
migration. Sometimes a package is kept from migrating due to a
transition, the occurrence of new bugs in unstable, buildd issues or
other problems. In these cases, the Testing Security team considers
the possibility of issuing a DTSA. We always appreciate it when the
maintainer contacts us about their specific security problem. When we
are in communication then we can assist by telling you whether to wait
for migration or to prepare an upload to testing-security. For non-DDs,
these uploads can be sponsored by every DD, preferable by a member of
the Testing Security team. If you get a go for an upload to
testing-security by one of us, please follow the guidelines on the
webpage[4]. If we feel the need to issue a DTSA and were not contacted
by the maintainer, we normally go ahead and upload ourselves, although
efforts by maintainer to be involved in this process is much preferred.

An up to date overview of unresolved issues in testing can be found on
the tracker website[5].



Embedded code copies
--------------------

There are a number of packages including source code from external
libraries, for example poppler is included in xpdf, kpdf and others.
To ensure that we don't miss any vulnerabilities in packages that do so
we maintain a list[6] of embedded code copies in Debian. It is preferable
that you do not embed copies of code in your packages, but instead link
against packages that already exist in the archive. Please contact us about
any missing items you know about.



Some statistics
---------------

* 35 DTSAs had been issued in 2007 so far for over 139 CVE ids
* 39 NMUs were uploaded in the last two months to fix security flaws
* 49 security related uploads migrated to testing in the last month for 71 CVE ids
* 5500 CVE ids had been processed by the team so far for this year



New Testing Security Members
----------------------------

New members are constantly added to the team. The most recent additions are
Nico Golde, Steffen Joeris, and Thijs Kinkhorst. The circle of team members
who may approve releases to the testing-security repository has also been
enlarged by Stefan Fritsch (since May), Nico Golde and Steffen Joeris
(both added recently).

If you are interested in joining the team, we always need more people,
and it's not very hard to contribute in very small ways that have large
impacts! Contact us if you are interested. You may want to also look at
our helping page[7].

So far so good. We hope to keep you updated on testing security issues
more regularly.

Yours,
Testing Security team
