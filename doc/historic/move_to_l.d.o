Hi,

as the effort to offer security support for Debian Testing has become more
official than it was when it started in 2005, and to make it easier to find
this announcement list, we have decided to move this list from alioth to
lists.debian.org. The planned date for the switch is June 25th.

For you this means:

1. Subscribers of the old list will be migrated to the new list automatically.

2. This list, secure-testing-announce@lists.alioth.debian.org will be renamed
to debian-testing-security-announce@lists.debian.org. Mails to you will come
from the new address.

3. The mailinglist headers will change. If you filter for headers, please
adjust your setup accordingly. The new header will be:

List-Id: <debian-testing-security-announce.lists.debian.org>

4. The subject will no longer contain the prefix [SECURITY].

5. Mails will originate from a different server. If you had any special
configuration (like an exception from grey-listing) for the old server, change
this to:

	lists.debian.org a.k.a. liszt.debian.org
	82.195.75.100

6. For unsubscribe instructions, look at the footer of announcements mails sent
from the new list.

7. The list archive will move to

	http://lists.debian.org/debian-testing-security-announce/


If you experience any problems, don't hesitate to contact us.
