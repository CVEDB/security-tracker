During DebConf13, a spontaneous BoF came up from new security team contributors about flaws in the current documentation in the team.
Here are the gobby notes.

Principles
----------
 - avoid repetition, more centralized.
 - make it easy to update
 - heavily inter-linked
 - a reference
 - lesson learnt collection
 - review and revalidation (eg, in new-member-time)
 - openness (all documentation should be readable by everyone - does any documentation have to be private?)

How to interact with the security team
------
 - As a vulnerability reporter
   - public issues
   - private issues (embargo)
 - As a maintainer
   - DSA vulnerability
   - SPU vulnerability
   - Just unstable
 - As an upstream
   - document how to contact when embargoed issues arise

Organization
------
 - Communications channel
   - Specify public/private ; internal/external
   - What each list is for:
     debian-security@lists.debian.org
     debian-security@debian.org seems to be redirected to debian-private@lists.debian.org
     debian-security-tracker@lists.debian.org
     team@security.debian.org
     (and more)
     - consolidate lists? (which are needed?; explicit names, e.g. -public/-private)
   - RT? (incoming queue for non encrypted mails)
 - Contributors: Members of the security-testing alioth project, the "tracker"
 - Assistants: Members of the private list, no access to private key
 - Members: "core" members
 - How to become a member.
 - What kind of work you can do with each grant
 - Who is on which internal upstream security list? (e.g. kernel,
   mozilla)

Workflow Overview
-------
 - Terminlogy: DSA, SPU, embargo, etc...
 - The Security Tracker
 - General high level view of "narrative introduction"
 - What happens after an upload of a package to chopin: DSA, buildds, proposed-updates ... (where to find logs, how to remove bad uploads, ...)

How to interact with the Security Tracker
-------
 - A more structured version of "Narrative Introduction"
 - How to contribute to the security tracker code (Florian)
   (including how to install a test instance)
   
Release a DSA
-------
 - A more structured version of the current wiki pages

Internal (?) processes
-------
 - Front desk: what needs to be done
 - Private queue in RT
 - "Special" packages
 - CVE ids pool: when to use, how to ask more ids
 - "Resolutions", "Announces"? like the Amazon CDN for security.debian.org (bits from the security team)
 - Access to private key
 - Access to upstream bug trackers

What do we have
--------
- narrative introduction
- some wiki pages
- teams page
- some (hidden) documentation in repo
- section about security in developer's reference
- Securing Debian Manual (harden-doc) -> linked in the main page?
  - update it
